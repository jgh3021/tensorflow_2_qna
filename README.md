# tensorflow_bert
This repo aims to implement BERT via tensorflow2's keras throughout pre-training and fine-tuning.

There're amounts of architectures which is used to train language models with changing hyper parameters or tuning ensembles models. 

For all beggineers who study NLP, this would be very helpful to learn codes and conceptions of BERT.

Requirements
  Tensorflow 2.0.0
  tensorboard 1.14.0
  python 3.6

Notice
  I would appreciate it for all developers who provide ideas and git-repo.
  When those's ideas and codes are added in this repo, I would comment those's locations.
